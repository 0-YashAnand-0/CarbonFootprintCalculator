# Carbon Footprint Calculator
by Yash Anand

## Description
As a part of 'Task 5: Carbon Footprints', we were asked to find out Carbon Footprints & calculate them. We had been asked to use online tools available - preferably OpenSource tools - to calculate our Carbon emissions and document them. However when I was using them, I realised that the criterias being used for these calculations, were very limited and would often exclude major carbon emitting activites such as meat consumption, food wastage, access to solar energy, etc.

All these important activities were being excluded which I believed meant that the result were likely incomplete and inaccurate. Additionally none of these calculators were, as I mentioned earlier, OpenSource tools. Therefore, in order to counter all these issues at hand, I decided to create a Carbon Footprint Calculator which would allow users to positively modify it's data & make help make these calculations more accurate. 

A much more detailed explaination of how this whole project came out to be has been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQreU8kJKfRYXW_cn7ZiehrpI8U7v7ijtbIAWY4w9xc/edit#). Additionally, a very simple and easy to understand guide has been provided below to allow everyone to use this calculator to calculate their Carbon Footprints in Kg/Month.

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account.
* 'C Extensions' Installed In Codespace.

### Guide
Simple steps for using the calculators

* Open 'CarbonFootprintCalculator.c' from the repository -> click on the 3 dots -> click GitHub.dev

* In the left panel, click Remote Explorer -> Create a new codespace -> Select your storage

* Click on 'Install' when the promt pops up -> click on Run & Debug -> Use the calculator
